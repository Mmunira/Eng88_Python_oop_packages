# python OOP
### Packages
#### Modules

##### The four pillars of OOP are:
- Encapsulation - removing access part of your code and making it private, yet available 
  e.g. _dob = 01/01/1991 # the underscore in front of dob makes it private
  
- Inheritance - Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
  
- Abstraction - To abstract something means to hide away the details inside something for example, when we are calling a function e.g datetime functions
- Polymorphism - e.g if inheritance is used properly then you can use the parent class like their children
