# python OOP
### Packages
#### Modules

##### The four pillars of OOP are:
- Encapsulation - hiding the data, making it private yet available 
  e.g. _dob = 01/01/1991 # the underscore in front of dob makes it private
  
- Inheritance - Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
  
- Abstraction - 
- Polymorphism

  
# What are python modules
# We have built in modules that we can can find on Python Library
# if the value is 1.49 floor() 1, ceil() 1.51, 2
# we have a keyword called import that we can use to call a module


# from random import random
# import math
#
# random_number = random()
# print("This is randomly generated" + str(random_number))
# if random_number >= 0.5:
#     print(math.ceil(random_number))
# else:
#     print(math.floor(random_number))
#
# #OR
#
# from random import random
# import math
#
# num1 = random()
# print(num1)
# if num1 >= 0.5:
#     print(math.ceil(num1))
# else:
#     print(math.floor(num1))


# num1 = 23.66
# print(num1)

# if the user input is >= .50 apply ceil() - use random() to generate a number
# if the user input is <= .49 apply floor()

# print(math.ceil(num1))
# print(math.floor(num1))
# what is the use case?
